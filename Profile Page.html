    I was born in Rotterdam and lived in Berkel en Roderijs for the first 2.5 years of my life. My parents decided to move to a more laid
    back part of the Netherlands to raise their children. Like I said on the introduction page, I'm from a small village named Stellendam. 
    I've lived here eversince my parents decided to move. I actually prefer a small town like Stellendam over a 'big' city like Rotterdam, 
    so I think in the future I'll keep living in a small town.

        Spare time activities
    </h2>

    Eversince I was a little kid, I've really enjoyed riding a skateboard. I've been doing it for about 11 years now. I still  Like
    to practice skateboarding eventhough I don't have as much time as I used to have. I've been practicing judo for roughly 13 years now.
    Judo is something that I also still really enjoy doing. Besides practicing judo and skateboarding I like to listen to music, read, watch 
    Youtube videos and occasionally play video games.

        Other interests
    </h2>
    When I listen to music I mostly listen to metal and classic rock. I grew up listening to primarily classic rock bands like Kiss,
    Black Sabbath and Guns 'n Roses. Over the years I also grew to appreciate heavier genres of music. I also attend concerts relatively 
    often and festivals in the summer. I also like to read. When I read, I mostly read historical and mythological books. I don't really watch any movies  or series.
